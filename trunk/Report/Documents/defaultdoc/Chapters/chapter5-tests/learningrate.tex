\section{Learning rate}
This section is about tests with the learning rate of the agent. The more thorough explanation of the generalization can be read here \ref{qlearning}.
By changing the $\gamma$ and $\alpha$ values the agent will learn differently - so we have made a test where we have run between 15000 to 100000 iterations. All the test have been run with 5 vultures against 12 marines. The graphs from the test can be seen in full size in the appendix \ref{appendix}. We will make test over how much damage the vultures have dealt and how many units we have lost and how many units we have killed. As mentioned before will these test be performed with different learning values. It is worth mentioning that 5 vultures against 12 marines is a very hard battle for the vultures and the marines are favoured to win that battle.
