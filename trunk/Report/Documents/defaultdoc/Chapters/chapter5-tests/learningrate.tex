\section{Comparing $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ Values}
This section is about the tests with the learning rate of the agent. The more thorough explanation of the generalization can be read in section \ref{qlearning}.
By changing the $\gamma$ and $\alpha$ values the agent will learn differently,  so we have made a test where we run between 15000 to several hundred thousand iterations. All the test have been run with 5 vultures against 12 marines. The graphs from the test can be seen in full size in the appendices chapter \ref{appendix}. We will make tests over how much damage the vultures have dealt, how many units we have lost, and how many units we have killed. As mentioned before  these test will be performed with different learning values. It is worth mentioning that 5 vultures against 12 marines is a very difficult battle for the vultures, and the marines are favoured to win.
