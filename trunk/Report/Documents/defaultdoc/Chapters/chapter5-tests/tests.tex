In this Chapter we will describe the test results of mirco battle to test our AI bot. We have two test maps, which all our test are going to be performed at.
The first map is  zerglings against vultures and the other map is marines against vultures. We have the first map, because zerglings have a lower movement
speed then vultures, so the vultures should have be eable to win the battle with out losses. In the second map is more interesting, because the marines
are ranged units, this means we can see how well our bot do comperted with the built-in bot. The maps are  designed so that the player with the vultures
are weaker then the other player. This means our bot can improve and should be better then the built-in bot. In the first map it is 20 marines against 5
vultures and the other map it is 30 zerglinges against 5 vultures. Each test will be tested on the two maps. \\
 In the first test we like to know how the vultures are doing, if they only attack when they get shoot on. This will help us understand how strong the
two armys are compert with each other and what losses we can expect. The other test will test the potential fields and what effact they have on the result.
In order to tesst this we will look at the difference with potential fields and without them. The last test we will test reinforcement learning and see how
fast the bot will improve over time. We will do this by comparing serveral test runs.
