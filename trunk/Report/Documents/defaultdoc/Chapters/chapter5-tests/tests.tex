In this Chapter we will describe the test results of mirco battles between the AI bot and the built-in bot in starcraft. We will make two tests. 
In first test we will test our bot controlling vultures against zerglings. Because the zerglings have a lower movement speed, we expect our bot
to be eable to out mirco the built-in bot without any losses. In the other test our bot will play against marines. This test is interesting because
marines are ranged units. In order to tell if our bot have improvmented from the built-in bot, we will do the same test, but where the built-in
bot's opponent is only fighting back then the built-in bot is attacking.
