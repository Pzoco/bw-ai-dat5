\chapter{Implementation}
This chapter will explain implementation of the parts of the bot. This is done by showing code snippets and examples. First we will look at the core of Bayesian Networks, then the overall structure of the managers. Then the implementation of the different potential fields. At the end we will look at how we implemented Q-Learning.\\
To communicate with Starcraft Broodwar we use an API called BWAPI, a link can be found in the bibliography \cite{bwapi}.
