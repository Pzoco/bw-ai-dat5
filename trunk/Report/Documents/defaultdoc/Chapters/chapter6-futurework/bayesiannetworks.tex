\section{Prediction Networks}
	The project we use Bayesian networks for prediction of the enemy base position, the enemy's buildorder and the current threatlevel. 
	It is hard to make the prediction of the enemy base position, because not a lot of data can be analyzed in the first minutes in the game. 
	The Bayesian networks made for predicting the buildorder of the enemy is very simple and only can predict a few buildorders, so if the enemy is 
	using a build that is not in our network it can not predict it. Both these networks could be better at predicting by using data mining. If the 
	bot could train the networks by watching replays or by using the data from a replay. If we had more time we would make the buildorder prediction 
	more precise using a node for early game, mid game and late game. That way it will be a better identification of the buildorder and of the current 
	threatlevel.
