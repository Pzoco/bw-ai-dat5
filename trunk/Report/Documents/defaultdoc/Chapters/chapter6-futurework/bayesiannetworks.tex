\section{Future Work on Prediction Networks}
	The project we use Bayesian networks for prediction of the enemy base position, the enemy's buildorder and the current threatlevel. 
	It is hard to make the prediction of the enemy base position, because not a lot of data can be analyzed in the first minutes in the game. The
	SCV have to go from base to base until it finds the opponent's base and there is no way to improve this, because the bot have fog of war.
	The Bayesian networks is made for predicting the buildorder of the enemy, yet it is very simple and can only predict a few buildorders, so if the enemy 		is using a build that is not in our network it can not predict it. Both these networks could be better at predicting by using data mining. If the 
	bot could train the networks by watching replays or by using the data from a replay. If we had more time we would make the buildorder prediction 
	more precise using a node for early game, mid game and late game. That way it will be a better identification of the buildorder and of the current 
	threatlevel. \\
		We could have liked to use Bayesian network for is predicting when the opponent is going to attack. This would be based on what 				infomation the bot gets from scouting, where the must importent node in the Bayesian network would be the build order and the units the opponent
	have.
