\chapter{Design}\label{design}
	In this chapter we will distinguish between the word agent and bot, where an agent is a program thats able to learn and chance itself, and the bot it the more static. \\
	
	In this chapter we are going to look at the design of the bot. First we will take a look at the different managers we use for controlling units, producing buildings, scouting bases and choosing strategies. Then we explain potential fields, and how we use them to micro the bot. In order to correct the bot and make sure that it will be able to learn, we will explain reinforcement learning. For the macro part we are going to use Bayesian networks to detect the opponent's build order, predict the opponent's start location, and find the threat level of the opponent.	\\
	The purpose of the design is to make an agent that is able to out micro its opponent in combat. To limit the scope we will only look at vultures. 
	This implies the following:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Construct the necessary buildings to produce vultures.
		\item Construct a squad of vultures.
		\item Scout and find the enemy's base.
		\item Move the squad to the enemy's base and attack.
	\end{itemize}
	
%	Potential fields are a vector based representation of an environment. Potential fields are commonly used in robotics to guide a robot trough environment, but it is also becoming more and more popular within computer games\ref{ptf_in_game}. Objects in this environment can change position and the field will adapt accordingly.
