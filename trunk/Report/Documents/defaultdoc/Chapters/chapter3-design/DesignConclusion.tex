\section{Design Summary}
In this chapter we compared the different tools we use in constructing our bot. We separate different parts of the games into different managers so we can easily manage our bot. We then decided to use potential fields for movement. This is because it would be impossible to come up with a generic algorithm that takes all of the variables in a game into account. To compute the best forces for the different potential fields we use a generalization of Q-learning. Generalization of Q-learning works well in our case because of extremely high number of states in a Starcraft Broodwar game. For analyzing information we decided to use Bayesian networks. We chose to come up with networks for enemy spawning positions, enemy build orders, and enemy threat. In the next chapter we will discuss how we implement these concepts.
