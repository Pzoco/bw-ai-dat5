\section{Conclusion on Potential fields}
	Potential fields look promising. They consist for several smaller fields, each with its own variables that can be adjusted to optimise the potential field as a whole. Each of these variable can then be taught using some kind of machine intelligence. It is also easy to add new or remove existing fields if needed, making the potential field highly adjustable which is a good feature in a game where small errors can have a large impact.
