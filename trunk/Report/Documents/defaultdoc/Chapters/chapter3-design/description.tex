\subsection*{Description of bot}
	The purpose of the bot is to be able to out macro humans in combat, to limit the scope we will only look at vultures. 
	To do this but should be able to play a full Starcraft game. Tis implies the following:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Construction the necessary buildings to produce vultures.
		\item Construct a squad of vultures.
		\item Scout and find the enemies base.
		\item Move the squad to the enemies base and attack.
	\end{itemize}
	
	To control the squad in combat we will use potential fields learned useing reinforcement learning.
	To construct the buildings, produce vultures, move to the enemies and scout we will be using a series of manages, some of which will be equipped with Bayesian networks, to make predictions of spawn location and tactics.
	Each of these parts will be designed, implemented and test separately, then merged at the end to make a full bot.
