We mention some different areas of the game one has to master to be good or even perfect to win, we also mention some different standard attack methods one can use to slow down the opponent. At last we analyse what kind of unit we want a computer to control.

This chapter is where the theory is being used in practice, and here we explain how we have implemented the potential fields, and how we have implemented the learning part of the agent.
