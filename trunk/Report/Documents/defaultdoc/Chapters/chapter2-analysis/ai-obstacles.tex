\section{Obstacles for the bot}
	This section will feature some of the problems that the bot can have making it easy to defeat.
	\subsection*{Building placement}
		In Starcraft Broodwar it is very important to build your building in such a 
		way that your units won't get stuck in them and building them such that you make the most out of the space given. Because every map have 
		a different layout, we would either have to come up with a way to place building regardless of the map played or have to hard code the building 
		placement for every map.
	
	\subsection*{Flexibility}
		If the opponent does something that the bot doesn't know how to react to it may have lost the game already. 
		It is impossible to determine every 
		thing that can happen, but one small thing can lose you the game.
