\section{Challenges for the Bot}
	This section will feature some of the problems that the bot can have that might not be much of a problem for human player.
	\subsection*{Building placement}
		In Starcraft Broodwar it is very important to build your buildings in such a 
		way that your units won't get stuck in between  them. You also want to make sure you make the most out of the space you are given. Because every map has
		a different layout we would either have to come up with a way to place building regardless of the map played or have to hard code the building 
		placement for every map.
	
	\subsection*{Flexibility}
		If the opponent does something that the bot doesn't know how to react to it may stand no change of winning. 
		It is impossible to determine everything that can happen, but one small thing can make you lose the game.
