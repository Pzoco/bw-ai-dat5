\section{Bot Analysis}
	This section will discuss the way we will apply machine intelligence to control our bot. It is interesting to look at how a bot compares to a human both physically and mentally. 
	
	\subsection*{Outplaying a human player}
		A bot can easily physically outplay a human player in Starcraft Broodwar. 
		Doing micromanagement is really demanding for a human because it requires a lot of actions and fast reaction. A bot may be able to control each 
		attacking unit individually and make intelligent decisions on attacking according to health, cooldown and other factors. This is nearly impossible for a human to do in a large scale. This is why a bot that is focusing on micromanagement could be interesting to make. Another point 
		is that while a player is doing micromanagement a lot of other actions are needed elsewhere. If these tasks are not handled this could lose one the game.
		
	\subsection*{Outsmarting a Bot}
		Outsmarting refers to either bluffing, tricking or just making good decisions. This will be hard for a bot to do, because there are so many 
		different strategies. Being able to reacting to everything and be able to counter these strategies will be difficult. Something unexpected 
		can break the bot down completely.

\subsection{Choice of Main Focus}
	The area we think the bot will really be able to out play a human is in micro. It can do this by controlling a lot of units very precisely. This is interesting since it will be able to do something that is impossible for a human player, i.e. the bot will be able to control one unit at a time. It will also be easier to spot the learning part of the bot because the performance can be measured, e.g. units killed.
