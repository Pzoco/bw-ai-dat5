\section{Bayesian Networks and decision threes}
In this section we are going to define bayesian networks and decision threes. Then we are going to compare the two decision models and choose
the best model our bot can use for scouting analysis.

\subsection{Bayesian Networks}
Bayesian networks are simpel grafical models, where each probability for the variable is calculared. Therefor the bayesian networks is used for
calculating new probabilities, whenever new infomation is gathered. So a bayesian netorks have a  set of variable and
these variable is connected with directed edges. Each variable in the bayesian network must have a finite set of mutually exclusive states. By this we mean
that :::. To make sure that we can calcular a result, the bayesian network needs to be a acyclic directed graph. A variable needs a conditional probability 
table for each of it's parents. This means that the amount of calculations in a bayesian networks depends on the number of variables and the edges that
connects them.
