\section{Terran tactics}
	Compared to the last section, this section will feature some more concrete ways of winning a game as a Terran player. 
	These tactics are important to analyze, because if the bot is going to win it will need to know these tactics.
	The following subsections are tactics, which can win you the game when playing as Terran.
	
	\subsection{Timing Push}
		A timing push is an attack, which either hits when a specific upgrade is done and/or when the opponent is vulnerable in his specific build order. 
		Because a bot can be very precise a timing push can be deadly. Making it attack when a specific upgrade should be trivial to do, but for it to 
		analyze when the opponent is weak, may be a more difficult task. It would require the bot to find out which build order the opponent is using and 
		then changing it's build order or strategy to fit a timing attack. If the bot could succed in doing this, it would take opponents off guard.
		
	\subsection{Pushing}
		The term {\it pushing} refers to an attack which finds place when the Terran player has gained a large army after being defensive for a long 
		period of time. It is called pushing because the idea is to push the opponent 
		all the way back to their base, where they will deal the finishing blow. This is a Terran tactic which very easy to execute because it is for the 
		most part easy to defend your base as Terran and when you do the push your army will be so strong that not much can beat it.
		
	\subsection{Harass}
		Harassing is a tactic that every race can use, but here the Terran ways of doing it will be explained. Doing drops is one way to harass, dropping 
		refers to transporting units in to the opponents base. The most normal drops for Terran are done with vultures and marines. The vultures are 
		fast and can take out the workers in the base. It can also place mines so enemy units can not come defend the workers. When dropping with marines 
		the purpose is usually more to destroy important enemy buildings than to kill workers, but both is viable. The vultures can also be used without 
		dropping them, because of their superior speed they can easily slip past enemy units and in to the main base. Doing harassment requires 
		good multitasking ability, because if you keep your units out of sight for one second they might be destroyed and if you forget to macro you can 
		get far behind too. This is a field that the bot can really show its abilities, because it is something that is hard for a human to do, but 
		easier for a computer.
	
	\subsection{Mining the map}
		In this tactic vultures are used to gain map control by placing mines all over the map. If the opponent wants to attack he will need to destroy the 
		mines, which can give the Terran player security and a way of establishing a superior army and economy. 
		This is also a tactic that requires a lot of multitasking and is quite closely related to the harassment tactic, because they both act in a 
		aggressive way.
