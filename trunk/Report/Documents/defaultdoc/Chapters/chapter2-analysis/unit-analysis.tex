\section{Unit Analysis}
We will now take a look at three Terran units which could be interesting to micro. In the analysis of the units we will
focus on the range, movement speed, damage, armor, availability, micro benefits, and fire cooldown. 

\subsection{Marines}
Marines are interesting because they can shoot air and ground units. The upgrade stimpacks increases the marines movement speed and the fire rate
faster from 7.5 to 15. This makes the unit very dynamic and gives it high micro benefits. Marines are easy to get and are normally the first unit a Terran uses in
their army. Marines only have a range of 4 and are the slowest unit that we are going to take a look at. Their
hit points are only 40. Since marines can be gotten so early on they are a good candidate for the project. On the other hand, to get the full profit from the
marines they need upgrades and support from medics to heal them. 

\subsection{Vultures}
Vultures are a little car with a high speed, a range of 5 and hit points of 80. This means a vulture can out micro a marine. Like the marines, the
vultures also have upgrades. The most interesting upgrade is the spider mines that allows the vultures to place three mines. When another unit goes near the mine will it detonate dealing a large amount of splash damage. The vultures are made
from the Factory which means you will be able to get marines before you get vultures. The good thing about vultures is the prize is only 75 minerals (where
a marines is 50 minerals). Having all this in mind, it is clear that vultures have much to offer in terms of micro.
That being said the vultures fire cooldown is 30 fps which is double the time of the cooldown of a marine.\cite{wiki_vulture}

\subsection{Wraiths}
Wraiths are air units that can attack ground and other air units. This means that they are not depended on surroundings which allows it
to move over large distances within a short time. They are interesting because they have an upgrade that allows them to turn invisible while they have energy. Wraiths have a range of 5, and have 120 hit points which is 3 times more then a marines. It has the same fire cooldown
as a vulture when attacking ground units and 22 fps when attacking air units.  
The down side of the wraiths is the price( 150 minerals and 100 gas) and we need a Starport to built it. This means
there is a long time before you can get actually buy wraith. It is clear there is a lot of micro benefits from choosing this unit. 

\subsection{Choice of unit}

We have chosen to work with vultures because they have a fast speed, and a cooldown we can utilize when they are attacking multiple units, they can attack a unit and retreat to avoid getting injured and by that be able to distribute the damage they all have to give to the opponent. Vultures are also fast to get so if the bot should play a full game it can defend itself in the early stages of the game.
