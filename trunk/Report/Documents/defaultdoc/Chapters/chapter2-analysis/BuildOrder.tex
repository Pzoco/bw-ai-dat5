\section{Build order}
A build order as an early game strategy describing in which order certain building and units should be produced\cite{wiki_build_order}. The purpose of a build order is to optimizing the players economy and control the timing of units to give the player the highest advantages at certain points in the game.\\
The build order depends on many factors like the specific map played and the race of the different players in the map. 
Early game scouting can help determain the other players build order, and coutering there tactic.\\

Build order is mostly important at the beginning of the game, and depends a lot on timing. The player must choose a spot to build a certain building but also ensure a worker is there to do it, and make sure the player has the required recources. A good player can time this. So his worker reaches the construction site at the exact time he have enough mineralt to actually build the building.\\

Later in the the game the player must adapted strategy depending on the information recived about the other player.
