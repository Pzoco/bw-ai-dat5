\section{Futurework on potentialfields}
	If we had more time to work on the potential fields they could use a lot of adjustments. They work well for our test case against the marines, but when used in most normal maps during a real game they need to take a lot more things into account. An example would be building, right now they are not mapped in the potential field, so the units will try to move trough the building as they do not know they exist. The same goes for mineral patches and gas geysers. 
	
	Another thing to look at would be useing a different set of forces for different senarioes, like defending the base and attacking other bases.
	
	We could also use more time adjusting the constants we filled in our self, to try and see what works best.
