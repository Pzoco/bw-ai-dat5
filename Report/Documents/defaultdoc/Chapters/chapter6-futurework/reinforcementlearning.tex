%Different reward values - so it might be more greedy and maybe defeat the enemy even faster
%We could even use different learning algorithms, maybe even an approximation of the NN (http://www.stat.yale.edu/~arb4/publications_files/neural%20net%20approximation.pdf)
%Taking way more things to 'consideration' e.g cliffs, edges, spawn locations, build orders (basicly everything in that game that generates a number)
%It could be cool to make it learn a common path, so it could use the bombs it can place all over the map :)
%We could use Fuzzy logic aswell http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic
%Ofcourse - run it until it converges - and here a super-computer would be nice!
