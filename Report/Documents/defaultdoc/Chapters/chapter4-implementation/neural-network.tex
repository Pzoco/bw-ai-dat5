\section{Neural Network}

%Intro
A neural network is similar to how the brain obtains new information, and learns it. The human brain is made up of about 100 billion neurons, and each neuron is connected with thousand of other neurons communicating via electrochemical signals. The neuron gets a lot of input and when the neuron has filled a threshold it fires through something called an axon. This automatic method of filling up information and storing it when a certain threshold is reached can be implemented in a computer.



%Description
There are different ways of connection a neural network, but we will be concentrating on the method called \textit{feedforward}. The way to feed the neuron is by applying different inputs to it, and before entering the neuron the input goes through some weights, that is adjusted manually. Just like before if the input in total is greater or equal to a certain threshold the neuron will output a signal, if it's less it will output zero.
%Explain about feedforward somewhere


%Technical details
A neuron can have from 1 to n number of inputs, and each input will be multiplied by its weight
If we have input $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_n$ the weights calculated will look like $x_1 w_1 + x_2 w_2 + x_3 w_3 + .. +  x_n w_n$
