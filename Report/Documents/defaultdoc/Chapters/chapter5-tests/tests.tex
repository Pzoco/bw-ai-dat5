In this Chapter we will describe the test results of mirco battles to test our AI. We have two test maps, which all our test are going to be performed in.
The first map is  zerglings against vultures and the other map is marines against vultures. We have the first map, because zerglings have a lower movement
speed then vultures, so the vultures should have be eable to win the battle with out losses. In the second map is more interesting, because the marines
are ranged units, this means we can see how well our bot do comperted with the built-in bot. The maps are  designed so that the player with the vultures
are weaker then the other player. This means our bot can improve and should be better then the built-in bot. In the first map it is 20 marines against 5
vultures and the other map it is 30 zerglinges against 5 vultures. Each test will be preformed on both maps. \\

 In the first test we will make the build in AI fight it self, to know how the vultures are doing, and have a base case to compare with. This will help us understand how strong the
two armys are compert with each other and what losses we can expect. The other test will test the potential fields and what effact they have on the result.
In order to test this we will look at the difference with potential fields and without them. The last test we will test reinforcement learning and see how
fast the bot will improve over time. We will do this by comparing serveral test runs.

\section{First Test}
So in this test the two forces are just attacking each other. This means the vultures are losing in both maps. Below is a list of the resultes from the test
in the two maps.

\begin{centering}
 \begin{tabular}{|l||c|c|c|c|}
	\multicolumn{5}{c}{First Test Resultes From First Map} \\
	\hline
	\ Players & Produced units & Killed Unit & Lost Units &  Total Unit Score \\
	\hline
	\hline
		Player with vultures & 5 & 9 & 5  & 875\\
	\hline
		Player with zerglings & 30 & 9 & 5 & 1500\\
	\hline

\end{tabular}

	\multicolumn{5}{c}{First Test Resultes From Second Map} \\
	\hline
	\ Players & Produced units & Killed Unit & Lost Units &  Total Unit Score \\

	\hline

	\hline
		Player with marines & 20 & 5 & 5 & 1750\\
	\hline

\end{tabular}

After this first test we know how weaker the player with the vultures are compared with the opperant.
