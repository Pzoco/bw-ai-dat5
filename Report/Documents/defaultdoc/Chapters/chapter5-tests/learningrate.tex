\section{Learning rate}
This section is about tests with the learning rate of the agent. Here is the explanation about the generalization of the q-learning \ref{qlearning}.
By changing the $\Gamma$ and $\alpha$ values the agent will learn differently - so we have made a test where we have run between 15000 to 40000 iterations. All the test have been run with 5 vultures against 12 marines.


\begin{centering}
 \begin{tabular}{|l||c|c|c|c|}
	\multicolumn{5}{c}{Alpha value 9 and Gamma value 2} \\
	\hline
	Players & Produced units & Killed units & Lost units\\
	\hline
	\hline
		Player with vultures & 5 & 9 & 5 \\
	\hline
		Player with zerglings & 30 & 9 & 5\\
	\hline
