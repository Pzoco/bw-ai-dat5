\section{Potential fields}
	Potential fields can be used to represent an area of the game using vectors.  The vectors are calculated based on all the objects in the area, and then used to calculate a path trough the area.

	Objects can have an attractive or repulsive type of influence in the potential field.
	
If we begin by introducing a single enemy unit into an empty out world the entire area begin flooded with vectors pointing toward this point, as seen in figure \ref{fig:seekbehavior}. This is called the Attractive behaviour because it makes our own units want to reach this point in order to attack it.

	Likewise if we assume there is only a single obstacles in the area (a unit we do not want to attack) it would generate a repulsive field around it, see figure \ref{fig:avoidbehavior}. This is called the Repulsive behavior because it causes our own units to try and move away from it.

	These two kind of behaviours can then be combined to make a map that can tell our unit how to move around enemy units and reach a specific target as seen in figure \ref{fig:combinedbehavior}.

	\subsection{The math behind potential fields}
		A simple potential field can be described as below.\\
		
		Variables:\\
		$f =$ force\\
		$s =$ size of the potential field\\
		$c =$ fade of constant\\
		$d =$ distance\\
		\begin{displaymath}
			%\begin{math}
			Attractive = \begin{cases}
					-f & \text{if $d < s$}\\
					0 & \text{else}
				\end{cases}		
			%\end{math}
		\end{displaymath}
			
		\begin{displaymath}
			%\begin{math}
			Repulsive = \begin{cases}
					0 & \text{if $d > s$}\\
					f * c & \text{else}
				\end{cases}		
			%\end{math}
		\end{displaymath}
		But we need to have more then just these to simple cases as explained in the next chapter.
