\chapter{Design}\label{design}
	In this chapter we are going to look at potential fields and reinforcement learning.
	
	Potential fields are a vector based representation of an environment. Potential fields are commonly used in robotics to guide a robot trough environment, but it is also becoming more and more popular within computer games\ref{ptf_in_game}. Objects in this environment can change position and the field will adapt accordingly.
