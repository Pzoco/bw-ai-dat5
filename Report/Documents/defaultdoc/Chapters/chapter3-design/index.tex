\chapter{Design}\label{design}
	In this chapter we are going to look at the designing of the bot. We will look at reinforcement learning and potential fields for microing the bot and 
	at Bayesian networks for predicting the start location and threat level of the opponent.
	
	Before we can design these parts of the bot, we need some kind of skeleton in which these parts can be placed. This first section will explain how the 
	bot is controlled by an interconnection of multiple managers.
	
%	Potential fields are a vector based representation of an environment. Potential fields are commonly used in robotics to guide a robot trough environment, but it is also becoming more and more popular within computer games\ref{ptf_in_game}. Objects in this environment can change position and the field will adapt accordingly.
