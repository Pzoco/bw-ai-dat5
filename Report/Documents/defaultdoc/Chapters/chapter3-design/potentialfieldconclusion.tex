\section{Conclusion on Potential fields}
	Potential fields looks promising, it consist for several smaller field, each with its one variables that can be adjusted to optimise the potential field as a hole. Each of these variable can then be learned using some kind of machine intelligence. Its also easy to add new or remove existing fields if needed, making the potential field highly adjustable, a good feature in a game where small errors can have a large impact.
