	We humans make decisions every day, they may seem trivial, but if computers were to make them they would be very difficult. The reasoning we do 
	is based on our preferences and needs, which is not something that computers have. 
	If we were to make a computer think as a human a lot of reflection is needed, and if we really want it to be near humans in decision-making we need 
	to specify a specific task for it. If one looks at the intelligence of robots, which is trying to emulate the human mind 
	it is easy to see why are specific task is needed. One field where artificial intelligence is commonly used is in video games. When playing 
	a game you want to have you opponent to be as intelligent as a human player to get the right challenge or when there are no 
	human players to play with. \\
	
	For this project we will be writing a bot for a game called Starcraft Broodwar. The game is a RTS (Real Time 
	Strategy) game, which requires a player to build a base for maintaining an in-game economy and build an army, 
	which can defeat the opponents army and base. One of the reasons why creating a bot for Starcraft is 
	especially interesting is because of the almost computer-like speed and precession required for mastering the game, 
	which is something that is easy for a computer. 
	In Starcraft you can choose between three races: The insectoid Zerg, the advanced alien race Protoss and the Human-like Terran. 
	The three races are all different and excels at different skills, which means that the strategies used differs when 
	facing the each of the races. 


\section{Purpose}
	The purpose of this project is to create a computer-bot which can play Starcraft Broodwar. 
	The bot is going to learn how the game fundamentally works, 
	how to win the game and how to react to what the opponent does. 
	To do this we will apply machine intelligence theory concerning decision trees and machine learning.


\section{Problem Statement}
	Our goals for this project is to:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Create an intelligent bot for the game Starcraft Broodwar
		\item Apply machine intelligence theory in the modeling of the bot
		\item Make a bot that can improve by playing Starcraft
		\item Learn the bot a sample of built orders, so it can use the best strategy
		\item Make a bot that can compare the known variables and chose the best strategy
		\item The bot should take variables like map and the opponents races into account 		
		\item Make sure the bot analysis the battles and know if it should pull back.
		\item The bot should know push timings and scout before a possible push timing.
	\end{itemize}
