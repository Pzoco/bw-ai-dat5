	We humans make decisions every day that may seem trivial, but for computers these decisions would be very difficult. The reasoning we do 
	is based on our preferences, needs, and experience. Computers on the other hand do not have preferences or needs. One can argue that computers can
	make decisions based on experience.
	For computers to make decisions like humans a lot of reflection is needed because computers can't think, instead they can only perform a series of tasks.
	One field where we could specify such task would be in video games, a field where \abai is commonly used. When playing 
	a game you want to have your AI opponent to be as competitive as a human player to get the right challenge. \\
	
	For this project we will be writing a bot for a game called Starcraft Broodwar. The game is a \abrts game, which requires a player to build an army 
	which can defeat the opponent. One to create a bot for Starcraft is the computer-like speed and precession required for a human player to master the game. 
	This precession is difficult for humans to master but is simple to program a computer to do.
	In Starcraft you can choose between three races: The insectoid Zerg, the advanced alien race Protoss and the Human-like Terran. 
	The three races are all unique and excel at different skills, which requires players to adapt their strategies depending on which race they are facing.


\section{Purpose}
	The purpose of this project is to create a computer-bot which can play Starcraft Broodwar. 
	The bot is going to learn how the game fundamentally works, 
	how to win the game, and how to react to what the opponent does. 
	To do this we will apply machine intelligence theory concerning decision trees and machine learning.


\section{Problem Statement}
	Our goals for this project is to:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Create an intelligent bot for the game Starcraft Broodwar
		\item Apply machine intelligence theory in the modeling of the bot
		\item Make a bot that can improve by playing Starcraft
		\item Make sure the bot analysis the battles and know if it should pull back.
		%\item Learn the bot a sample of built orders, so it can use the best strategy
		%\item Make a bot that can compare the known variables and chose the best strategy
		%\item The bot should take variables like map and the opponents races into account 		
		
		%\item The bot should know push timings and scout before a possible push timing.
	\end{itemize}
