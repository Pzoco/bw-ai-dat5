\section{Unpredictability}
	When playing tournaments or just playing a normal match being unpredictable can win you the game. 
	If your opponent is adapting to your play style you can put him off by doing something different or playing strange.
	In tournaments psychology is a big factor, professional players can make the other player do a certain strategy because they know 
	how the other player will react to certain things. This feature will be hard to near impossible to learn the bot, because the bot won't be able to 
	identify the opponent's playstyle. If it can not identify the playstyle it will not be able to put the opponent off. Our goal is for the bot 
	to win against other bots, so the aspect of unpredictability may not be important at all.
