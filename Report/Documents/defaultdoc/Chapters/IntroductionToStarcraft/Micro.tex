\section{Micro}
\subsection{Controling individual units}
	Micro management is an important part of starcraft broodwar. Micro-management requires a player to control their units so that you can get the most out of them. There are several ways to do this.\\
	 For a human player this can be very difficult as it requires a lot of concentration and can hurt an inexperienced player macro-management. An advantage for a computer player is it can concentrate on macro and micro management and will not slip up.\\
One way to do this is to keep units alive as long as possible. The idea behind this is simple if your units stay alive after a battle. Players sometimes move hurt units out of battle and then back in. The reason for this is that the enemey will then start attacking another one of your units and then your hurt unit can enter back in the battle and continue doing damage. The idea behind this is that a unit will do the same amount of damage no matter how much health it has but will do no damage if it is dead.\\
	Another form of micro is making several of your units attack one unit at a time. A computer can do very well at this because it can perform calculations so that is knows how many units it takes to kill another unit in one shot. This is usefult so that too many units don't waste their shot in killing one unit when they can be doing damage to other units.\\
